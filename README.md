## Github Rating App with React Native

This application has been built during the full stack open MOOC's part 10 about React Native (worth 2 ETCS). https://fullstackopen.com/en/part10

The app is connected to a Node.JS backend application, which was not built by me, so this repo only has the "frontend" aka mobile app code. Backend can be cloned from: https://github.com/fullstack-hy2020/rate-repository-api.

Check the available scripts from package.json, but basically `npm install`& `npm start`. Also I installed expo globally on my machine.
